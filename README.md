## Introduction :wave:

Welcome to my repo for the Makers Academy Curriculum - week 1, day 1!

My task was to create an program that will accurately emulate the infamous "Boris/Santander Bikes" of London (a network of stations and bicycles that anyone can use) - including the process of docking a bike, releasing a bike, and reporting problems with infrastructure (repairs, etc).
