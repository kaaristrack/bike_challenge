My task was to create an program that will accurately emulate the infamous "Boris/Santander Bikes" of London (a network of stations and bicycles that anyone can use) - including the process of docking a bike, releasing a bike, and reporting problems with infrastructure (repairs, etc).

The original brief for this challenge can be found [HERE!](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/0_challenge_map.md)

### Key Focus

Object-Oriented Design (OOD).

### Stack

### Implementation

1) Clone this repository, and change into the correct directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaaristrack/boris_bikes
$ cd boris_bikes
```
2) Open in IRB or PRY.
```
